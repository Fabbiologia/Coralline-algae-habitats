" Coralline algae habitats: an environmental and microstructural assessment to understand microbial niches" authored by Patricia M. Valdespino-Castillo *et al.*

In the folder `data` three datasets are available to reproduce the analysis in the manuscript: 
- `level_5.csv` stores level 5 bacteria taxa and their abundance; 
- `halophila.csv` stores an extract of the Halophila taxa in the samples found in the algae;
- `env.csv` stores the environmental data collected on site and physiological parameter of the algae.
